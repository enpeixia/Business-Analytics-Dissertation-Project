About datasets (csv files) used in this project:

"CAMPOSOL.csv" is the chosen shipper-commodity combination.

"ensemble.csv" is the data used for Random Forest. 

"merged.csv" is the file used to compute directional accuracy, which contains the predictions from all the models. 

The raw data and the data after cleaning is too large to be uploaded to this repo. They can be accessed via the below link, where
"raw.csv" is the original bill of lading data from ImportInfo.
"finaldata(1)" is the data after the full cleaning steps

All these scv files can be traced down in the jubyter notebook "FullCode.ipynb".
